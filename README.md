# upass-spork
i want to have my own little program to save all my passwords!


trying to be more sequre with my passwords, so i tought okay that my be great to have a little python programm.
that would handle all my password,
the initial idea is, encrypt everything so it cant be encoded, encrypt it with the one and only password, we dont use
in this program.

then if the correct password is entered we would load and decrypt everything (or what we need).
when we pass the "username" of that password i would like to have it copied to my control V, already so i can just paste it wherever.
and that is it basically.

maybe add autopass generators as well.

todo:
1.create interface to save text data, and get it by calling the "name".

2.sequre the key opener for the file in a secure file

3.create interface to be able to get asked data after successful login.

maybes:
add actual gui, windows and stuff.
